VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. Introduced in 2014, VADER text sentiment analysis uses a human-centric approach, combining qualitative analysis and empirical validation by using human raters and the wisdom of the crowd.
